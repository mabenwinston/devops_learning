1. Introduction

a). What is Django?

** Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
** Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
** Django is especially helpful for database driven websites.

b). How does Django Work?


=> Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.
=> The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.
=> The models are imported from the models.py file.
=> The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.
=> The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.

** Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).

Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.

---> Model

** The model provides data from the database.
** In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM), which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.
** The models are usually located in a file called models.py.

---> View

** A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.
** The views are usually located in a file called views.py.

---> Template

** A template is a file where you describe how the result should be represented.
** Django uses standard HTML to describe the layout, but uses Django tags to add logic:
** The templates of an application is located in a folder named templates.

---> URLs

** Django also provides a way to navigate around the different pages in a website. This is done in a file called urls.py.
